# Quiz Game README

## Description
This Python script implements a simple quiz game where users are presented with questions loaded from a JSON file (`questions.json`). Users are prompted to select an answer from multiple-choice options. After answering all questions or quitting the quiz, the script displays the final score.

## Files
1. `quiz_game.py`: This is the main Python script containing the quiz game implementation.
2. `questions.json`: This JSON file contains the questions, answer options, and correct answers for the quiz.

## How to Use
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository containing `quiz_game.py` and `questions.json`.
3. Run the script `quiz_game.py` using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the prompts to answer the quiz questions. Type the number corresponding to your chosen option and press Enter.
5. To quit the quiz at any time, type 'q' and press Enter.
6. Once all questions are answered or the quiz is quit, the script will display the final score.
